# PepperHQ Frontend developer challenge

## TL;DR
* Coding challenge represents day-to-day work at PepperHQ
* Estimated time to complete: **1 to 2 hours**
* If you already have easily accessible examples of your own code you want to use instead, email us!
* We will use this as a way to initially analyse your abilities as well as for a code review and starting off point for a general technical discussion in the next step of the interview.
* If you have any feedback on the interview process, email us! 
* Go straight to [Task Specification](#task-specification)

## General
From our point of view, an arbitrary whiteboard test assessed by interviewers looking over your shoulder is an unrealistic way to measure how developers actually work on a day-to-day basis. Instead, we have tried to produce a challenge that represents some of the work that we do at PepperHQ.

This is a way for candidates to demonstrate their abilities to us if they don't have any freely accessible examples already. If you already have easily accessible examples that you feel demonstrates your abilities, feel free to send us an email and we can use this instead. 

After completing the coding challenge, one of our developers will analyse it. If this is positive, we will go on to the second stage of the process where we will use it as a way to start a dialogue in the form of a code review and general technical discussion.

We are always open to iterating on our interview process so please email us if you have any feedback.

# [Task Specification](#task-specification)

Our merchants have access to a wide range of tools to customise their Apps, Locations, and Menus. We integrate with a large number of Point of Sale providers, but sometimes this just isn't enough for our Merchants, who may need additional customisability of their Menu, and the products on it.

The task is to build a dashboard page that:
* Shows a list of all of the products in the following sample menu: `http://frontend-challenge-api.pepperhq.com/menu.json`
* Allows editing of the information for each product (though saving edits is not required!)
* Anything you think adds to the page, show us your creativity!

Your ability to design a stunning looking dashboard page is not what we're looking for here - we're more focused on the code powering it; So don't worry if you're not the web equivalent of Picasso!
