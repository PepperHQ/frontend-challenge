# PepperHQ Frontend developer challenge

## TL;DR
* The coding challenge is the first stage of our interview process at Pepper
* Estimated time to complete: **1 to 2 hours**
* Instructions on how to complete: [Instructions](#instructions)
* No need to do the challenge if you already have written similar code: email us a link to that repo instead
* Go straight to [Challenge](#challenge)

## General
From our point of view, an arbitrary whiteboard test assessed by interviewers looking over your shoulder is an unrealistic way to measure how developers actually work on a day-to-day basis. Instead, we have tried to produce a challenge that represents some of the work that we do at PepperHQ.

This is a way for candidates to demonstrate their abilities to us if they don't have any freely accessible examples already. If you already have easily accessible examples that you feel demonstrates your abilities, feel free to send us an email and we can use this instead. 

After completing the coding challenge, one of our developers will analyse it. If this is positive, we will go on to the second stage of the process where we will use it as a way to start a dialogue in the form of a code review and general technical discussion.

We are always open to iterating on our interview process so please email us if you have any feedback.

## [Instructions](#instructions)

* Copy or fork this github template into a new repo
* Complete the coding [Challenge](#challenge)
* Invite devchallenge@pepperhq.com to the repository.

## [Challenge](#challenge)

Our merchants have access to a wide range of tools to customise their Apps, Locations, and Menus. We integrate with a large number of Point of Sale providers, but sometimes this just isn't enough for our Merchants, who may need additional customisability of their Menu, and the products on it.

The task is to build a dashboard page that:
* Shows a list of all of the products in the following sample menu: `http://frontend-challenge-api.pepperhq.com/menu.json`
* Allows editing of the information for each product (though saving edits is not required!)
* Anything you think adds to the page, show us your creativity!

Your ability to design a stunning looking dashboard page is not what we're looking for here - we're more focused on the code powering it; So don't worry if you're not the web equivalent of Picasso!

We would prefer you to use `Node.js` and `TypeScript` as that's what we use, but you can use other tech / languages if you prefer.
